I've created an easy to use **ReadMe Generator**, using Node.  Following the simple guides, you'd be able to develop professional ReadMe. 

![Demo of Main page](assets/img/demo.jpg)

App uses three different APIs:
 * [Love Calculator API](https://rapidapi.com/ajith/api/love-calculator) to find Love compatibility & chances of successful love relationship based on names.
 * [Numbers API](https://rapidapi.com/divad12/api/numbers-1) - an API for interesting facts about numbers. Provides trivia, math, date, and year facts about numbers.
 * [GIPHY API](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/) -  content library of GIFs and Stickers to make app more fun end express emotions.

HTTP requests are implemented with use of AJAX, JSON to get data from third-party server-side APIs.

  

## Installation

## Usage
